# Almuz Website Work In Progress

That will be my personal website - portfolio.
I deiced to **MEVN** development stack.
MEVN - means **Mongo Express Vue.js and Node.js**.
Also here used **Docker** to connect all parts together.


## Folder structure
### client folder
In client folder based all frontend things.
Client makes API calls to the server where it's necessary.

### server folder
In server folder are Express with Mongo
Server works only as API and returns requested data to the client.
Also server saves all important data to Mongo Database
